# Pacmen

## Description
Pacmen is a JavaScript project that allows you to create and control multiple Pacman images on a web page. The project provides a factory function to create Pacman objects, positions them on the screen, and allows them to bounce off the walls.

## Installation
To use the Pacmen project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the Pacman image files (e.g., "PacMan1.png") in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Open the HTML file (`starter.html`) in a web browser.

## Usage
1. Press the "Make one" button to create a new Pacman. This will position the Pacman image randomly on the screen and add it to the "game" div.
2. As you create more Pacmen, each one will be added to the array of Pacmen, which keeps track of their position and velocity.
3. The Pacmen will move on their own, bouncing off the walls whenever they hit them.

## Customization
You can customize the Pacmen project by modifying the following aspects:
- Pacman images: Replace the existing Pacman image (`PacMan1.png`) with your own Pacman image files. Make sure to update the image source in the code accordingly.
- Pacman behavior: Adjust the velocity and movement logic in the JavaScript code to change how the Pacmen move and interact with the walls.
